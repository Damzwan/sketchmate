1. Enter select mode.
2. Tap the object or group of objects you wish to recolor.
3. Find and tap the paint icon (ðŸŽ¨) in the upper right corner.
4. You'll now have the option to adjust the following:

    - **Stroke Color:** Alter the color of your object's outlines. For text objects, this changes the color of the text
      border.
    - **Fill Color:** Add a solid color inside your object. For text objects, this changes the actual color of the text.
    - **Background Color:** Add a background color to your objects. Useful for emphasizing or isolating certain elements
      in your sketch.
