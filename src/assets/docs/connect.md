## Matching

To enjoy using SketchMate, start by connecting with someone. Here are two methods to get you started:

### Method 1: Scan QR Code

Follow these simple steps:

1. Tap the 'Scan QR code' button to open your camera.
2. Point your camera towards your friend's QR code.
3. Once the code is scanned, voila! You are now mates!

### Method 2: Share Connect Link

Here's another easy way to connect:

1. Tap the 'Share connect link' button to generate your unique link.
2. Share this link with a friend through any preferred method (text, email, social media, etc.).
3. Once your friend opens the link, you're connected as mates!

## Unmatching

In case you want to connect to a new person, you have to unmatch with your current mate:

1. Navigate to the "My Mate" page using the bottom navigation
2. Press the unmatch button
3. You can now start matching with another person

## Connection Limit

For the moment you can only share sketches with one person. If there is enough support (let me know!) I will definitely add this feature :)
