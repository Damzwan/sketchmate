## View your sketches in the gallery

In the gallery you can find the drawings you sent and the ones of your mate. Some things to note:

* In the upper right corner of a drawing you see who sent it
* In the lower right corner you see the amount of comments placed by you and your mate

The goal is to create an ever-growing memorable gallery of sketches just like a picture book.

## Entering big picture mode

By clicking on an image you enter big picture mode. You can also zoom in on the sketch if you want. In the bottom bar
you will see several options. These are from left to right:

* Start a drawing from this sketch
* Open the comment drawer
* Share the sketch through other social media platforms
* Delete your image

You will also see the first four comments (you can also open the comment drawer by clicking on them) in big picture
mode. To see all comments open the comment drawer.

### Hiding comments

If there are comments placed on a sketch, and you want to hide them then press the chatbox icon in the upper right
corner to hide them. Press it again to make them visible again

## Deleting multiple sketches

In case you want to delete multiple sketches at the same time:

1. Go to the main gallery page
2. Long tap on a sketch you want to delete to enter delete mode
3. Tap any other sketches you want to delete
4. Press the garbage button in the upper right corner to delete the images
