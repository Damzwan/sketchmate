In SketchMate, you can enhance your sketches by adding images or setting them as background. Here's how:

1. Click the add icon (+) on the toolbar and select either "Image" or "Camera".
2. Select an image from your device or take a new one with the camera.
3. A popup will appear with two options:

   - **Add the Image to the Canvas:** The image will be added as an object on your sketch, and you can interact with it just like any other object.
   - **Set the Image as Background:** You'll be prompted to crop your image to fit the canvas size. The selected image will serve as the background for your sketch.
