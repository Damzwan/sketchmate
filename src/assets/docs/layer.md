SketchMate's simple layering system allows you to control the order of your objects. It's like a digital version of a
stack of paper. Objects _added most recently appear on top, while older ones are layered below_.

You have **two actions** at your disposal:

- Move an object to the front
- Move an object to the back

Follow these steps to **modify an object's position** in the layer stack:

1. Enter select mode.
2. Select the object or group of objects you wish to reposition.
3. Click on the vertical three dots icon to open the options menu.
4. Select either "Move to front" or "Move to back" to adjust the object's position.
