Sometimes a drawing—like a character—is composed of multiple objects. Moving it around can be a bit of a chore. That's
where the merge action comes in handy. 

It allows you to **combine a selection of objects into one** unified piece, making it

1. Enter select mode.
2. Select the objects you want to merge.
3. Click on the vertical three dots icon to open the options menu.
4. Click the merge button.
