# Introduction

Welcome to SketchMate. We're here to make communicating with friends a bit less ordinary. With us, it's about sending
more than just words. Be it doodles, stickers, images, or text, we've got you covered.

# Tools vs Actions

Let's dive into the SketchMate user interface. That toolbar at the top? It's packed with tools and actions. Here's a
simple way to tell them apart.

## Tools üõ†Ô∏è

Think of tools as your basic utilities on SketchMate. Once you select a tool, it stays in use until you choose another.
It's as straightforward as that. The active tool has a **red underline**, so you won't miss it.

Notice a tool with a chevron symbol? It's got more up its sleeve. Click on it again to uncover additional options.

## Actions ‚öôÔ∏è

Actions, on the other hand, are single-use commands that perform a specific task, then return to a neutral state. They
don't remain active after being used, making them different from the tools.

Remember to visit the respective pages of each tool and action if you need detailed assistance or wish to discover
hidden features!
