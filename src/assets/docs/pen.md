# Pen tool ✏️

The pen tool lets you bring your imagination to the canvas. Here's how to use it:

1. Select the pen tool to start drawing.
2. Want to change things up? Click the pen tool again to access the following settings:
    - **Stroke width**: Make your lines thin as a whisper or bold as a shout.
    - **Brush type**: Choose the style that suits your vision.
    - **Stroke colour**: Pick the perfect shade to bring your creation to life.

Once you're done tweaking, close the menu. Your settings will be saved and ready for your next masterpiece.
