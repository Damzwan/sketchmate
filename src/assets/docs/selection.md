## Entering Select Mode

Click the select tool to highlight the last modified object. This action triggers 'Select Mode', causing the toolbar to switch to object editing options. You can identify a selected object by the border around it, which now is interactive.

Want to edit another object? Just tap it.

## Multiselecting Objects

Sometimes, you might want to manipulate several objects simultaneously. Here's how to do it:

### Mobile
- Long-press an object to enter the multiselect mode. You'll notice a small vibration and a number appearing on the toolbar. Now, each subsequent object you tap will join your selection.
- Draw selection rectangles in an empty space. Once you lift your finger, all objects intersecting with this rectangle will be selected.

### PC
- Draw selection rectangles in an empty space. Once you stop, all objects intersecting with this rectangle will join your selection.
- Hold shift and click to select multiple objects.

## Gestures

Once you've selected an object, you can rotate and scale it using the controls around the border. If you're using a mobile device, gestures are your friends:

- **Scaling**: Pinch with two fingers to adjust object size.
- **Rotating**: Use two fingers to rotate the object to your desired angle.

## Exiting Select Mode

Want to exit the Select Mode? You've got two options:

- Tap the close button in the upper left corner of the toolbar.
- Tap any empty space on the canvas.
