## Undo & Redo

Easily reverse or reinstate actions as you sketch:

### How to Use:
- After making changes like drawing or adding images, tap the undo button in the upper right corner to revert.
- If you wish to restore the undone action, tap the redo button.

**Note**: After undoing an action, performing a new one will clear any subsequent redo steps.
