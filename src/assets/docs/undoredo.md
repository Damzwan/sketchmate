## Undo and Redo actions

While creating a sketch, every action you perform can be undone and then redone:

1. After an action (e.g. drawing, adding images) you can press the undo button in the upper right corner
2. To redo this action you can press the redo button

Note that undoing an action and then performing a new action will delete the saved redo actions
